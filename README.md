# TikTakToeAI
Two versions of TikTakToe AI created by using two different methods
* Method 1( tiktaktoeai1.py): This version is the easiest to understand, build and to play against its made by using sinple conditional flow statements. Good old if-else and a few for loops thats about it. While being sinple to understand just showing how powerfull of a tool conditional statement is if used properly. While this AI puts up a hell of a challenge it still gives you chance to win.

* Method 2(TikTakToeAI.py): This version is a little bit harder to understand. Its build using MinMax function and recursion where after each move player makes AI will assess all the possible moves and each moves branches and choose the move which has heighest probability of giving winning outcome. This makes this AI near about impossible to beat. leaving only outcome as either Tie of Loss
